Hello World!

I'm excited to announce that my portfolio is now live!
https://johannes-biess.com/

Take a look and explore my projects - Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts.

Built with Nuxt 3, this portfolio is more than just a presentation; it reflects my values, my skills, and, most importantly, my drive to go beyond the ordinary.

I always aim not only to do my best but also to create something unique and to think outside the box.

I'm currently looking for an internship starting in March.
If you're interested, feel free to reach out! ðŸ˜Š
