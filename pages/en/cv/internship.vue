                The University of Design (HfG) has really shaped my skills in
                design and development. At this well-known university in
                Germany, I didnâ€™t just learn theory, but also got hands-on
                experience that has prepared me for the working world. The
                practical, project-based teaching gave me early insights into
                real-world work processes. What stood out to me the most was the
                focus on teamwork, which helped me improve my skills in a
                collaborative setting. Thanks to the iterative approach in
                teaching, I was able to learn all the steps from the initial
                concept to the finished prototype.
