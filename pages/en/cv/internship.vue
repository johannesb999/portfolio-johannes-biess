              In my internship, I gained a much deeper understanding of design tools like Figma. I learned not only
              to understand design systems, but also to create and use them efficiently. At the same time, I developed a
              clearer understanding of the work methods of UX/UI designers and learned how to significantly improve a
              product's usability by analyzing user flows and best practices. In addition to these technical skills, it
              was particularly important to learn how to deal with clients professionallyâ€”to understand their needs,
              manage expectations, and accept constructive feedback. Here is my detailed

              Working in an agency was an interesting and, above all, a new experience for me. Design methods that are
              given much less time in my studies are suddenly very useful, and you have to pay attention to details that
              didn't play a role in university. The internship and, above all, the employees at muse case showed me how
              work is sensibly structured and divided in a professional environment. I realized how essential clear
              communication within the team is for the success of a project. I learned to actively contribute to
              teamwork, take responsibility, and learn from mistakes to continuously optimize the workflow.What muse
