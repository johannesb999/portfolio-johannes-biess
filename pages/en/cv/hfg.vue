              that were very focused on getting hands-on experience right from
              the start. I learned to think deeply about fundamental questions
              like: What should I develop? How can I make sure it meets users'
              needs? What technologies are needed and how can I use them
              effectively? The HfG created an inspiring learning environment
              where I could not only build my design and technical skills, but
              also learn how to apply them in real projects. Take a look at my

              (HfG) is known for its real-world, project-based approach to
              training students. The school places a lot of emphasis on
              combining theory and practice, which gives students a good
              understanding of how work actually gets done. There's a strong
              focus on teamwork and working across disciplines, which prepares
              students for a collaborative work environment. Through a
              combination of hands-on learning and a strong link to practice,
              students learn all the steps from concept development to the
              finished prototype. Take a look at the
