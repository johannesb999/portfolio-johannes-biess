                During my time at HfG, I worked on
                <nuxt-link to="/en/project/projects" class="custom-link"
                  >projects</nuxt-link
                >
                that were practical from the start.<br />
                I was encouraged to dive deep into fundamental questions like:
                What’s worth developing? How can I make sure it meets user
                needs? What technologies are necessary, and how do I use them
                effectively? HfG created an inspiring learning environment where
                I could not only build up my design and tech skills, but also
                learn how to apply them in real-world projects.

                The University of Design (HfG) has really shaped my skills in
                design and development. At this well-known university in
                Germany, I didn’t just learn theory, but also got hands-on
                experience that has prepared me for the working world. The
                practical, project-based teaching gave me early insights into
                real-world work processes. What stood out to me the most was the
                focus on teamwork, which helped me improve my skills in a
                collaborative setting. Thanks to the iterative approach in
                teaching, I was able to learn all the steps from the initial
                concept to the finished prototype.
