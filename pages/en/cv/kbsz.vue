              During my time at the KBSZ, I obtained the Baden-WÃ¼rtenberg Abitur
              with a focus on economics and English. The decision not to go into
              business after graduating from high school but to study computer
              science was particularly formative for me.

              The "Fachgebundene Fachhochschulreife" is a school qualification
              in Germany that enables students to study all courses at
              universities of applied sciences and to study at universities in
              the respective subject area. In contrast to the general Abitur,
              there is no second foreign language and the focus is more on
              practical and vocational content. In comparison to the American
              education system, the subject-specific Fachhochschulreife lies
              between a high school diploma and an associate's degree. It offers
              access to specific, vocational courses of study, similar to the
              Abitur.
