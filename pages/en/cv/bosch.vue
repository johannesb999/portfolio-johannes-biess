              I spent a year at Bosch Automotive Steering GmbH, where I got to
              deepen my knowledge of software development and agile project
              management. I was a JIRA administrator, so I learned a lot about
              guiding teams and work areas towards more methodical processes and
              making existing workflows more efficient.
