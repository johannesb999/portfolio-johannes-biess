              While I was training as a wholesale and foreign trade merchant at
              D-TACK and the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK), I
              got to experience all the different departments of a wholesale
              company over the course of three years. I learned about
              purchasing, sales, marketing, and logistics in class and on the
              job. I also got to develop my soft skills, like teamwork,
