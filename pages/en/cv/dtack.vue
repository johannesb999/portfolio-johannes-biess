              The University of Design (HfG) has really shaped my skills in
              design and development. At this well-known university in Germany,
              I didnâ€™t just learn theory, but also got hands-on experience that
              has prepared me for the working world. The practical,
              project-based teaching gave me early insights into real-world work
              processes. What stood out to me the most was the focus on
              teamwork, which helped me improve my skills in a collaborative
              setting. Thanks to the iterative approach in teaching, I was able
              to learn all the steps from the initial concept to the finished
              prototype.
