              <h2>PROBLEM<span>GBUDAHAJKSBVFGKHAPOIVBAKSJHKAK</span></h2>
              <p>
                In our hectic daily lives, there is often little time left for
                the care of indoor and garden plants. Many people, especially
                those with stressful jobs or other time-consuming commitments,
                regularly forget to water, fertilize, or properly place their
                plants. This often leads to plants wilting, being over- or
                under-watered, or otherwise not receiving the necessary care.
                Statistics show that 37% of hobby gardeners let one or two
                houseplants die each year. Millennials, in particular, seem to
                have more problems, with about seven houseplants dying on
                average. Most people do not have a green thumb and lack the
                necessary knowledge to properly care for plants. How should one
                react to discolored leaves? What should be done about aphids? Or
                is my plant even sick? Improper care and lack of knowledge about
                the specific needs of plants often lead to frustration, sadness,
                and disappointment.

              <p>
                Our approach to developing PlantMonit followed a structured and
                iterative process, ensuring that we addressed both technical and
                user-friendly aspects of our product. <br /><br />
                <h3>Conceptional Process</h3>
                Persona Development We began by creating a detailed persona to
                identify and analyze the needs of our target audience. This
                helped us understand the specific requirements and challenges
                our users face, allowing us to tailor our solution accordingly.
                The persona served as a solid foundation for all subsequent
                design and development decisions. <br /><br />User Journey
                During the app development, we prioritized designing the user
                journey. This included creating detailed user paths to ensure a
                seamless and intuitive experience from app installation to daily
                use. The user journey helped us identify potential obstacles and
                continuously enhance the app's usability. <br /><br />

              <p>
             
                <br /><br />Prototyping and Feedback Our development process
                involved several prototyping phases: LoFi Prototypes: We created
                initial rough sketches to visualize the basic user experience
                and test fundamental functions. This phase focused on the
                structure and key interactions of the app. MidFi Prototypes: We
                developed more detailed designs, emphasizing component
                selection, text sizes, and layout decisions. This phase helped
                us refine the user interface and improve usability. HighFi
                Prototypes: We finalized the visual and functional aspects to
                ensure a realistic and user-friendly design. In this phase, we
                placed great emphasis on a consistent and appealing UI design.
                In each phase, we continuously gathered feedback from potential
                users and experts to make iterative improvements and optimize
                the product.

              <p>
                
                <br /><br />The technical
                implementation involved several steps, incorporating both
                innovative hardware solutions and modern software development
                practices. <br /><br />

                Hardware Design and Integration: We utilized ESP32
                Feather and ESP32 Cam for data collection and transmission.<br />
                These devices provided the flexibility and performance necessary
                for precise monitoring. <br /><br />

                The use of the OpenAI Vision API enabled
                advanced analysis of plant images, which was a novel solution at
                the time of development, making our app particularly innovative.<br /><br />

                Seamless communication between the ESP32 devices via Websockets
                ensured that all components worked efficiently together,
                providing reliable data transmission. <br /><br />
                Backend Development: By using MongoDB and Mongoose, we built a robust and scalable
                database structure that facilitated efficient storage and
                management of collected data. 
                <br />Our API development focused on
                fast and reliable data transfers to ensure a smooth user
                experience. 
                <br />Security measures like .env and user logins
                protected sensitive data. <br /><br />

                Frontend Development: We developed a
                user-friendly interface with Svelte, characterized by intuitive
                operation and appealing design. This ensured that users of all
                experience levels could easily use the app. Close alignment with
                prototypes and regular user feedback helped us achieve a
                consistent and attractive design that met our target audience's
                high standards.
