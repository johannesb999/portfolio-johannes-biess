              The course just asked us to do something with stars. <br/>We got a link
              to a CSV file that had around 340,000 stars and their data in it.
              <br/><br/>The course was more about learning the deployment pipeline
              <br/>than develop the content to something unique. <br/>Even so, we wanted to
              create a website that doesn't already exist in this form. <br/><br/>Many
              people believe that the constellation of the stars at the time of
              their birth has a special significance for their lives. This
              belief affects our choices and attitudes in everyday life, from
              horoscopes to astrological predictions.<br/> With our website, we aimed
              to show, in a fun way, that constellations are simply a random
              grouping of celestial bodies that appear coherent because of our
              perspective. Our goal was to offer a new perspective on the
              universe and to highlight that the supposed meanings of the
              constellations are just fiction.

              At the start of the project, we discussed how we wanted to portray
              the stars. <br/>We quickly decided to add a fun element by simulating a
              spaceship flying <br/>through space. This approach lets you see the
              stars and constellations from different angles, which makes it
              easier to understand how random the arrangements are.<br/> After some
              feedback discussions, we decided to put the idea of displaying
              scientific data on the back burner to focus more on the visual
              experience. <br/>As you move through space, the lines that connect the
              stars start to get distorted, making it harder to recognize
              constellations. <br/>This makes users realise that even a slight shift
              in perspective is enough to destroy these supposed constellations.
              <br/><br/> To make it more immersive, we chose a sleek, unobtrusive design
              for the navigation tools that blends in with the background
              without disturbing the visual focus on the stars.

                The result is an interactive website that lets users have some
                fun exploring space. <br/>You can view stars and constellations from
                different perspectives with the help of a simulated spaceship.
                <br/>The idea is to show that constellations are just a matter of
                perspective.<br/> There are some subtle animations that show how even
                small changes in the viewing angle can make the constellations
                seem less ordered. <br/>Users get to see first-hand how random the
                arrangement of the celestial bodies really isâ€”without any direct
                instruction, but through their own discovery and experience. <br/><br/>The
                website is built on the Svelte framework, and THREE.js handles
                the 3D environment. We store the star data in a MongoDB
                database, which is hosted on our own server along with the
                backend. We use Docker and Portainer to manage the
                infrastructure, and GitHub Actions provides us with a nearly
                automated deployment pipeline, which makes it easy to deploy the
                application.
