              The course asked to do something with stars. A link to a CSV file
              containing around 340,000 stars and their data was provided. The
              focus of the course was more on learning the deployment pipeline
              than on developing unique content. Despite this, the intention was
              to create a website that doesn't already exist in this form. Many
              people believe that the constellation of the stars at the time of
              their birth has special significance for their lives. This belief
              influences choices and attitudes in everyday life, from horoscopes
              to astrological predictions. The website was designed to
              demonstrate, in a fun way, that constellations are simply random
              groupings of celestial bodies that appear coherent due to
              perspective. The goal was to offer a new perspective on the
              universe and to highlight that the supposed meanings of the
              constellations are just fiction.

              The project began with a discussion on how to portray the stars. A
              decision was quickly made to add a fun element by simulating a
              spaceship flying through space. This approach allows the stars and
              constellations to be seen from different angles, making it easier
              to understand the randomness of their arrangements. Following
              feedback discussions, the idea of displaying scientific data was
              set aside to focus more on the visual experience. As movement
              through space occurs, the lines connecting the stars begin to
              distort, making it harder to recognize constellations. This
              realization shows that even a slight shift in perspective is
              enough to disrupt these supposed constellations. To enhance
              immersion, a sleek, unobtrusive design was chosen for the
              navigation tools, blending them with the background without
              distracting from the visual focus on the stars.

                The result is an interactive website that allows exploration of

                with THREE.js managing the 3D environment. Star data is stored
