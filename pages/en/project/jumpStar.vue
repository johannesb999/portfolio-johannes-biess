              The course asked to do something with stars. A link to a CSV file
              containing around 340,000 stars and their data was provided. The
              focus of the course was more on learning the deployment pipeline
              than on developing unique content.<br />
              Despite this, My intention was to create a website that doesn't
              already exist in this form. Many people believe that the
              constellation of the stars <br />at the time of their birth has
              special significance for their lives.<br />
              This belief influences choices and attitudes in everyday life,
              from horoscopes to astrological predictions. The website was
              designed to demonstrate, in a fun way, that constellations are
              simply random groupings of celestial bodies that appear coherent
              due to perspective. The goal was to offer a new perspective on the
              universe and to highlight that the supposed meanings of the
              constellations are just fiction.

              The project began with a discussion on how to portray the
              stars.<br />
              A decision was quickly made to add a fun element by simulating a
              spaceship flying through space. This approach allows the stars and
              constellations to be seen from different angles, making it easier
              to understand the randomness of their arrangements.<br /><br />
              Following feedback discussions, the idea of displaying scientific

              distracting from the visual focus on the stars.
