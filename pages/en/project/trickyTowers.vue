              The project focused on answering the question: <br /><br />
              What's the best way to draw attention to a shop window or
              building?
              <br />The goal was to determine the most effective way to
              advertise the university and increase its visibility in order to
              attract more potential students. The aim was to create an
              interactive installation that would<br />
              bring the university's shop window to life.

              TrickyTowers is an interactive shop window that attracts
              passers-by in a playful manner and offers an extraordinary
              experience.<br />
              The installation consists of a screen, a backlight projector, and
              a web app which, in combination with a webcam and Google
              MediaPipe, recognizes user hand movements. Once a user's hand is
              recognized, a game starts. <br /><br />The game principle of
              TrickyTowers can best be described as a type of Tetris with a
              physics engine. However, the objective is not to build rows, but
              to construct a tower as high as possible. The physical elements
              make building a challenge that requires skill and strategic
              thinking. This interactive experience not only captures attention
              but also actively invites users to engage with the installation
              and experience the connection to the university in a playful and
              positive way.
