            The aim of the project was to revolutionize the care of plants.
            Thanks to new technological possibilities and corresponding sensors
            PlantMonit continuously captures images of the plant and important
            Parameters such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature and Lighting
            conditions. These are created by artificial intelligence "Buddy"
            analyzed and classified. Buddy enables a simple efficient and
            optimal care of the Green Friends....<br />

              Our approach to developing PlantMonit followed a structured and
              iterative process, ensuring that we addressed both technical and
              user-friendly aspects of our product. <br /><br />
              <h3>Conceptional Process</h3>
              Persona Development We began by creating a detailed persona to
              identify and analyze the needs of our target audience. This
              helped us understand the specific requirements and challenges
              our users face, allowing us to tailor our solution accordingly.
              The persona served as a solid foundation for all subsequent
              design and development decisions. <br /><br />User Journey
              During the app development, we prioritized designing the user
              journey. This included creating detailed user paths to ensure a
              seamless and intuitive experience from app installation to daily
              use. The user journey helped us identify potential obstacles and
              continuously enhance the app's usability. <br /><br />

              Through this structured, methodical approach, we developed a
              product that meets our target audience's needs and significantly
              simplifies plant care. PlantMonit combines cutting-edge
              technology with a user-friendly design to ensure optimal plant
              maintenance. <br />
              Key Features of PlantMonit: Automatic Plant Monitoring: Sensors
              for soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and light continuously
              monitor the vital data of plants. Advanced Image Analysis: The
              use of the OpenAI Vision API allows for detailed analysis of
              plant images, contributing to early problem detection. Intuitive
              User Interface: A user-friendly app that presents all collected
              data clearly and provides personalized care tips. Seamless
              Integration: Efficient communication between hardware components
              via Websockets ensures reliable data transmission and easy
              setup. Scalable Database: A robust backend structure with
              MongoDB and Mongoose ensures efficient data storage and
              management. By combining these elements, we created an
              innovative solution that revolutionizes plant care and helps
              both beginners and experienced gardeaners keep their plants
              healthy.
