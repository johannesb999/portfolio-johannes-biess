              In the rush of everyday life, there's often not much time left for
              caring for indoor and garden plants. Many people, especially those

              experience of the application. <br />It was an iterative process,

              the web app was implemented using Svelte. The focus was on

              The process started with an analysis of the necessary hardware.<br />
              The functions of the smart tool were identified, leading to the
              selection of components such as an ESP32 microcontroller and
              various sensors for tracking environmental data.<br />
              The components were chosen and assembled to meet the system's
              requirements. A prototype was then built using rapid prototyping
              to quickly visualize the design. Fusion360 was used to 3D print a
              housing for the selected components, allowing for quick
              integration and early problem identification. After the housing
              was printed, all hardware components were connected and installed,
              ensuring that the hardware was both functional and practical for
              final use.

              the target group. From this, it became evident that the goal was
              to develop a solution enabling minimal time commitment for plant
              care, appealing to both hobby gardeners and experienced plant
              enthusiasts. Simultaneously, a user journey was designed to cover
              the entire app experience, from installation to daily use. By
              mapping out detailed user paths, a smooth and intuitive user
              experience was ensured. Combined with user testing, this resulted
              in a well-thought-out and user-friendly setup process that helped
              identify potential issues early and enhanced overall usability.

              <h3>Software Process</h3>

              The software process started with creating low-fi,<br />
              mid-fi, and high-fi wireframes to plan the structure and user
              experience of the application. <br />It was an iterative process,
              with a strong focus on refining the user experience at every
              stage.<br />
              Each version was improved based on user feedback. The high-fi
              Figma click dummy was used to test the user flow and ensure
              everything felt smooth and intuitive. <br /><br />After receiving
              positive feedback and being satisfied with the design, the web app
              was implemented using Svelte. The focus was on carefully
              translating the<br />
              Figma prototypeâ€™s features and ensuring that the user experience
              remained smooth and fast.

              <h3>Hardware Process</h3>
              The process started with an analysis of the <br />necessary
              hardware. <br />The functions of the smart tool were identified,
              leading to the selection of components such as an ESP32
              microcontroller and various sensors for tracking environmental
              data. The components were chosen and assembled to meet the
              system's requirements.<br />
              A prototype was then built using rapid prototyping to quickly
              visualize the design.<br /><br />
              Fusion360 was used to 3D print a housing for the selected
              components, allowing for quick integration and early problem
              identification. After the housing was printed, all hardware
              components were connected and installed, ensuring that the
              hardware was both functional and practical for final use.
