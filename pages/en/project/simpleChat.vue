              To get a feel for what users need, the process began by exploring
              other platforms. User research methods like user interviews and
              analyzing customer needs were used to gain a deep understanding of
              the <br />target group. These insights were used to create a rough
              prototype, which was then gradually improved.<br />
              As development continued, changes were made based on tests with
              potential users to enhance user-friendliness. The low- and
              mid-fidelity prototypes created in Figma served as a foundation
              for regular user tests. An iterative approach, incorporating user
              feedback, led to the development of a platform that is both
              functional and intuitive, simplifying the complexity of its many
              features.

              The result is SimpleChat, an all-in-one platform that lets users
              chat and offers other features to connect the university and
              students in new ways.<br /><br />
              One of the key features of the platform is the ability for users
              to maintain their own profiles. These profiles include key info
              like a public timeline where internships, studying abroad, and
              other big moments are documented. <br />There's also a tag system
              where you can store interests and relevant facts about the person.
              These features let other users search for people with specific
              experiences or interests. For example, they can search for someone
              who has stayed abroad in Costa Rica. The platform also includes
              the university itself and companies. The university can use the
              platform to manage a bulletin board, post grades and notifications
              directly on accounts, and combine several platforms.<br />
              Courses and team channels are also part of SimpleChat, so that
              teaching materials can be shared easily. Companies get restricted
              accounts and can use the platform to advertise job vacancies or
              search for people with specific skills that interest them.
              SimpleChat thus offers a way to communicate more effectively while
              becoming an integral part of university life and students' career
              planning.
