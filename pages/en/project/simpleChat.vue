              The university's current communication platform, Slack, is being
              replaced by a new dedicated platform that will make it easier for
              the university, students, and alumni to communicate with each
              other. The new platform needs to be simple to use and have lots of
              different features. The goal was to create a solution that would
              be used by all students and alumni to keep the connection to the
              university strong.

              To get a feel for what users need, we started by taking a look at
              what other platforms are out there. We used user research methods
              like user interviews and analyzing what customers want to really
              understand what the target group needs. We used these findings to
              put together a rough prototype, which we then made some more
              improvements to. As we went along, we kept making changes based on
              tests with potential users to make it even more user-friendly. We
              used the low- and mid-fidelity prototypes we made in Figma
              as a starting point for regular user tests. We used an iterative
              approach and took user feedback into account to create a platform
              that's both functional and intuitive. This effectively simplifies
              the complexity of the many functions.

              The result is SimpleChat, an all-in-one platform that lets users
              chat and offers other features to connect the university and
              students in new ways. One of the key features of the platform is
              the ability for users to maintain their own profiles. These
              profiles include key info like a public timeline where
              internships, studying abroad, and other big moments are
              documented. There's also a tag system where you can store
              interests and relevant facts about the person. These features let
              other users search for people with specific experiences or
              interests. For example, they can search for someone who has stayed
              abroad in Costa Rica. The platform also includes the university
              itself and companies. The university can use the platform to
              manage a bulletin board, post grades and notifications directly on
              accounts, and combine several platforms. Courses and team channels
              are also part of SimpleChat, so that teaching materials can be
              shared easily. Companies get restricted accounts and can use the
              platform to advertise job vacancies or search for people with
              specific skills that interest them. SimpleChat thus offers a way
              to communicate more effectively while becoming an integral part of
              university life and students' career planning.
