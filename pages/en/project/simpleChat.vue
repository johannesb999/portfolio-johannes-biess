              The university's current communication platform, Slack, is to be
              changed. Therefore, the task is to create an own platform that
              enables or even improves the communication between the
              university, students and alumni. The platform should be easy to use and offer a wide range of functions. The aim is to create a platform that is used by all students and alumni of the university

              First to get an Idea of what the users want, we conducted a
              survey of diffrent already existing platforms. After that we
              used diffrent methods of user research and design thinking like
              ..., ... and ... to create a low fidelity prototype. These
              methods brought several learnings which we used to create a low
              fidelity protoype and to do first test with some potential
              users. This feedback helped us to improve and overthink some of
              our ideas. For example we had to change our structure of
              navigation. The most dificult thing for us was it to create an
              interface which is able to combine all of the needed features
              and to keep it simple and user friendly at the same time.

              <h3>Interface Process</h3>
              The technical implementation involved several steps,
              incorporating both innovative hardware solutions and modern
              software development practices. <br /><br />

              Hardware Design and Integration: We utilized ESP32 Feather and
              ESP32 Cam for data collection and transmission.<br />
              These devices provided the flexibility and performance necessary
              for precise monitoring. <br /><br />

              The use of the OpenAI Vision API enabled advanced analysis of
              plant images, which was a novel solution at the time of
              development, making our app particularly innovative.<br /><br />

              Seamless communication between the ESP32 devices via Websockets
              ensured that all components worked efficiently together,
              providing reliable data transmission. <br /><br />
              Backend Development: By using MongoDB and Mongoose, we built a
              robust and scalable database structure that facilitated
              efficient storage and management of collected data.
              <br />Our API development focused on fast and reliable data
              transfers to ensure a smooth user experience. <br />Security
              measures like .env and user logins protected sensitive data.
              <br /><br />

              Frontend Development: We developed a user-friendly interface
              with Svelte, characterized by intuitive operation and appealing
              design. This ensured that users of all experience levels could
              easily use the app. Close alignment with prototypes and regular
              user feedback helped us achieve a consistent and attractive
              design that met our target audience's high standards.

            ]"
          />              <p>
              Through this structured, methodical approach, we developed a
              product that meets our target audience's needs and significantly
              simplifies plant care. PlantMonit combines cutting-edge
              technology with a user-friendly design to ensure optimal plant
              maintenance. <br />
              Key Features of PlantMonit: Automatic Plant Monitoring: Sensors
              for soil moisture, humidity, temperature, and light continuously
              monitor the vital data of plants. Advanced Image Analysis: The
              use of the OpenAI Vision API allows for detailed analysis of
              plant images, contributing to early problem detection. Intuitive
              User Interface: A user-friendly app that presents all collected
              data clearly and provides personalized care tips. Seamless
              Integration: Efficient communication between hardware components
              via Websockets ensures reliable data transmission and easy
              setup. Scalable Database: A robust backend structure with
              MongoDB and Mongoose ensures efficient data storage and
              management. By combining these elements, we created an
              innovative solution that revolutionizes plant care and helps
              both beginners and experienced gardeaners keep their plants
              healthy.
