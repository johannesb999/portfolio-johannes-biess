              How do i represent myself in a way that is both professional and
              engaging? How do i showcase my skills and experience in a visually
              appealing manner that is simple and established but in some way
              new and modern. How do i make sure that my portfolio is not only a

              my values? These are the questions that i asked myself when i

              would not only present my work but also show who i am and what i

              would serve as an application, reflect my personality, follow the
              conventions of web design, and still look modern, unique, and
              individual. I wanted a design that would look clean and show off
