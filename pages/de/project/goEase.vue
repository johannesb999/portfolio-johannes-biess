              Der öffentliche Nahverkehr in Deutschland steht vor großen
              Herausforderungen.<br />
              Es gibt viele verschiedene Busunternehmen und Verbände, die
              jeweils ihre eigenen Tarifsysteme haben. Oft gibt es keine gute
              App-Lösung oder gar keine.<br />
              Fahrgäste, insbesondere diejenigen, die nur gelegentlich
              öffentliche Verkehrsmittel nutzen, stehen vor einem verwirrenden
              System. Sie wissen oft nicht, welches Unternehmen auf ihrer
              Strecke fährt, geschweige denn, wie sie ein Ticket kaufen oder den
              richtigen Tarif wählen sollen. <br />Dazu kommt, dass die
              Fahrkartenautomaten oft kompliziert, unhygienisch und defekt sind,
              was den Prozess noch schwieriger macht. Es wäre großartig, eine
              einfache Lösung für den Busverkehr zu haben, besonders an Tagen,
              an denen das Auto nicht verfügbar ist, wie an einem regnerischen
              Tag oder bei unerwarteten Ereignissen. Stattdessen machen die
              unterschiedlichen Tarife und das Fehlen einer zentralen Lösung es
              vielen Fahrgästen schwer.<br />
              Die Idee für GoEase entstand aus der Überlegung, wie wir den
              öffentlichen Nahverkehr zugänglicher und bequemer machen könnten.
              Die Idee hinter GoEase ist ein Beacon-System, das einfach in
              Bussen in ganz Deutschland nachgerüstet werden kann. <br />In
              Kombination mit einer mobilen App, die nur einmal eingerichtet
              werden muss und dann im Hintergrund läuft, ist das Ziel, eine
              vollautomatisierte und bequeme Möglichkeit zu schaffen, mit dem
              Bus zu reisen—ohne über Tarife nachzudenken oder ein Ticket an
              komplizierten, unhygienischen Automaten zu kaufen.

            <div class="paragraph">
              We kicked things off with an intensive brainstorming session,
              where we chatted through all the ideas and came up with some
              initial concepts.<br />
              Our initial vision was pretty ambitious. We wanted to create a box
              that integrated all kinds of functions. We wanted to use GPS to
              record the location, BLE to detect which cell phones were
              currently boarding, and a light barrier to check the number of
              people boarding. We also planned to create three different user
              interfaces—one for the end user and two for the public transport
              companies that send fare evasion figures and help set up the
              system. The system should be able to be used on all public
              transport, not just buses. <br />That means trains, buses, planes
              and ships too. <br /><br />This first idea included lots of
              different features and was meant to be a complete solution for the
              whole transportation industry. As the project went on, though, we
              realized that trying to implement all these features would not
              only take longer than we thought, but it would also get in the way
              of the core idea.<br />
              All these planned features made the project look more like a bunch
              of random functions than a focused idea. So we decided to go back
              to the drawing board and focus on the essentials. We trimmed the
              features down to just the essentials so we could zero in on the
              core idea: making bus travel easier and more convenient. The new
              plan was to have a box that works with just one app and is only
              for buses at first. This made things simpler and let us focus on
              one API, for example, without having to think about other
              interfaces.<br />
              This focus helped us make the core idea work well and get it off
              the ground, and create a solid MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that
              we could build on later.

              <h3>Software Process</h3>
              Next, we started working on the user interface and app features.
              First, we put together some wireframes and design dummies in Figma
              to get a feel for the user experience and make sure the app would
              be simple to use. The wireframes were really important for
              planning the user experience in advance and spotting any potential
              design issues early on. During this phase, we made sure the user
              experience was simple and straightforward. We used these
              wireframes to build the mobile app with React Native, which lets
              us use it on different platforms.<br />
              <br />We chose React Native because it lets the app talk to the
              beacons via BLE. <br />We made sure to get the core functions up
              and running smoothly and efficiently, including things like
              automatic beacon detection, trip data collection, and background
              processes. The software development process was very iterative.<br />
              Once we had the first functional prototypes up and running, we did
              a few rounds of user testing to get feedback and make sure we were
              constantly improving the app and the features it had based on what
              the testers had to say. It was really important for us to get
              direct feedback on how easy the app was to use and what we could
              do to make it even better. One of the most important things we
              wanted to get right with the app was the setup process. We wanted
              it to be quick and easy for the user. <br />Once you've set up the
              app, it's basically ready to go. It runs in the background and
              takes care of all the steps needed to record bus journeys and
              organize billing. You can also monitor your journey and see which
              costs have already been debited.<br />
              This way, you're always in the know and in control.

              <h3>Hardware Process</h3>
              The hardware process was all about choosing the right technical
              components to make the beacon technology work. It was crucial that
              the beacons were energy efficient, cost-effective, and easily
              retrofittable in buses to make it easy to roll out across the
              entire fleet. After quickly thinking through what the hardware
              needed to do, we decided on an ESP32 LilyGO, which has both BLE
              and GPS capabilities, covering all of our functional requirements.
              To keep costs down and make it simple to retrofit, we designed a
              plastic housing and 3D printed it. We also added a strap with a
              buckle to the housing so it can be mounted on various poles.
              <br /><br />This was a smaller step than the software development,
              but it was crucial to create the technical basis for the entire
              system and ensure smooth functionality in everyday use.

              GoEase is an innovative system that's set to transform bus travel.
              GoEase brings together an easy-to-install beacon system and a
              user-friendly mobile app to create a fully automated and
              convenient way to use public transport. <br />Once you set up the
              app, it does all the heavy lifting in the background, making bus
              travel as easy and carefree as possible. The beacon, which is
              based on an ESP32 LilyGO, is designed to be integrated into
              existing buses and uses BLE to communicate with the app. This
              hardware is affordable, simple to install, and can be mounted in
              different ways on the bus to make it easy to use. With GoEase, you
              can buy tickets without even having to tap in. The app detects
              when you board, records the distance traveled, and calculates the
              fare—all without you having to do a thing.<br />
              While you're on your journey, you can check in on your progress
              and see what your costs are. For passengers, this means maximum
              convenience and transparency. <br />The idea behind GoEase is to
              make things simple.<br />
              We've got rid of all the unnecessary steps that often make public
              transport complicated and unattractive. No complex fare systems or
              unreliable ticket machines—just a simple, intuitive solution that
              makes public transport more accessible and lowers barriers to
              entry. GoEase is a great way to use public transport, especially
              for people who don't use it all the time. It's also a better, more
              future-proof alternative to existing systems.
