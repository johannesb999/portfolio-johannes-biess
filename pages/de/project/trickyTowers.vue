              The project focused on answering this question: What's the best
              way to draw attention to a shop window or building? We wanted to
              find out how we could market our university better and make it
              more visible to the public to attract more potential students. We
              wanted to create an interactive installation that would make the
              university's shop window come alive.<br /><br />
              The idea was to create an installation that would get people's
              attention and make them curious about the school. We wanted to
              turn the shop window into a place that not only grabs your
              attention but also leaves a lasting impression. The goal was to
              attract more students to our university.

              We started off with a big, intensive brainstorming and research
              phase for this project. We wanted to figure out the best way to
              reach young people who are interested in both technology and
              design so they'd know about our degree program. It didn't take
              long to realize that just having a shop window with animations or
              videos wouldn't be enough. Not many people stopping by will take
              the time to watch any videos. We quickly decided to develop an
              interactive solution. It was really important for us to come up
              with a design that would get people's attention and also make them
              curious about what we had to offer. The installation had to be
              designed in a way that made it easy for people to interact with
              it. This would help to keep their interest and make it simple for
              them to use.

              TrickyTowers is an interactive shop window that attracts
              passers-by in a playful way and offers an extraordinary
              experience. The installation consists of a screen, a backlight
              projector and a web app which, in combination with a webcam and
              Google MediaPipe, recognizes the user's hand movements. As soon as
              the user's hand is recognized, a game starts. The game principle
              of TrickyTowers can best be described as a kind of Tetris with a
              physics engine. However, the aim is not to build rows, but to
              build a tower as high as possible. The physical elements make
              building a challenge that requires skill and strategic thinking.
              This interactive experience not only attracts attention, but also
              actively invites users to engage with the installation and
              experience the connection to the university in a playful and
              positive way.
